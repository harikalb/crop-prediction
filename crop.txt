Nitrogen effect on soil:

1)Nitrogen  is the most abundant element in the atmosphere and is usually the most limiting crop nutrient.
2)Without enough nitrogen, plant growth is affected negatively. With too much nitrogen, plants produce excess biomass, or organic matter, such as stalks and leaves, but not enough root structure. In extreme cases, plants with very high levels of nitrogen absorbed from soils can poison farm animals that eat them  
Phosphorous effect on soil:

Important in cell division and development of new tissue. Phosphorus is also associated with complex energy transformations in the plant. Adding phosphorus to soil low in available phosphorus promotes root growth and winter hardiness, stimulates tillering, and often hastens maturity.
Pottasium effect on soil:

Increases disease resistance, helps stalks to grow upright and sturdy, improves drought tolerance, and helps plants get through the winter

pH is so important to plant growth because it determines the availability of almost all essential plant nutrients. At a soil pH of 6.5, the highest number of nutrients are available for plant use
